==> You can over ride the exisitng classes by writing styles by our own. 

=> Margins & Paddings
    -> should have to give these numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, auto(for center), like some 0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem, 1.5rem, 3rem
    -> m-1 = mx+my = margin
    -> mt-2 = margin-top
    -> mb-3 = margin-bottom
    -> ms-4 = margin-start
    -> me-4 = margin-end
    -> mx = ms+me (X-axis) => ms-2 me-2 = ms-2
    => my = mt+mb (y-axis) 

    => there is no auto for padding. 
    -> p-1 = px+py = margin
    -> pt-2 = padding-top
    -> pb-3 = padding-bottom
    -> ps-4 = padding-start
    -> pe-4 = padding-end
    -> px = ps+pe (X-axis) => ps-2 pe-2 = ps-2
    => py = pt+pb (y-axis) 

=> Bootstrap Icons
    -> class="bi bi-android"
    -> bi = bootstrap-icon 

=> Grid system
    -> The whole page can be devided into rows and columns
    ->  .container
            .rows
                .col -> we can consume 12 columns per one row.
    -> If we devide a complete page into half each half contains 6 columns. 
    -> If we devide a complete page into 3 parts each part contains 4 columns. 
    -> If we devide a complete page into 4 parts each part contains 3 columns. 
    -> for nested elements also each element contains 12 columns. No comparison with the parent element. 
    -> height doesn't matter. We will get a scroll bar for height according to the content. but there should be no bottom scroll bar in bootstrap. 
    -> class="col-1", "col-2", etc
    -> col-6 => exactly half of the page
    -> "col" is a non-responsive class 

    -> to make it responsive, we have to use breakpoints recommended by Bootstrap

    Breakpoint	    Class infix	    Dimensions (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/)
    Extra small	        None	    <576px
    Small	            sm	        ≥576px
    Medium	            md	        ≥768px
    Large	            lg	        ≥992px
    Extra large	        xl	        ≥1200px
    Extra extra large	xxl	        ≥1400px     

    -> syntax => .col-<screenSize(class infix)>-<columnNumber> => .col-sm-6, .col-md-4, .col-lg-3 etc.,

    -> for small -> 2 cols -> 6*6                                   => .col-sm-6
    -> for medium -> 3 cols -> 4*4*4                                => .col-md-4
    -> for large -> 4 cols -> 3*3*3*3                               => .col-lg-3
    -> for extra large -> 6 col -> 2*2*2*2*2*2                      => .col-xl-2
    -> for extra extra large -> 12 col -> 1*1*1*1*1*1*1*1*1*1*1*1   => .col-xxl-1

=> List-group
    -> for ul -> .list-group
    -> for li -> .list-group-item
